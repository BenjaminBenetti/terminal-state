# The Reactor (`reactor`, tier 3)

The culminating level, built from the user-selected concept **B "Industrial Service Cathedral"**: a subway station on the rim of a vast
vertical industrial pit. Dense steel gantries, an overhead crane, organ-like pipe banks and auxiliary generators descend through
stratified toxic gas to the dormant reactor core at the bottom. The player restarts the core. The concept original stays private,
outside Git.

## The level, top to bottom (one continuous world; the rim at y 0, depth negative)
- **Rim** (`levels[0]`): a real subway station. One platform of about 70 m beside a track bed (tunnels continue past the bed ends;
  at most one Beyond-the-Station annex). Wide openings onto the railed rim gallery give the first view down to the core. The rim
  control office holds the startup key and the pit status board.
- **Four walkway tiers** (about 6 m apart): steel galleries on the pit walls, big landings for the generators, bridges across the
  pit to 1–2 free-standing lattice towers, and side rooms cut into the rock (maintenance stores, the switchgear room on tier 4).
- **The core floor** (about −30 m): the ring round the domed vessel, the pump hall and the control room overlooking the vessel.
- **The pit air rises above the rim** to about +15 m: the crane runway, the trolley and its hanging hook, and the tops of the pipe
  banks.
- **Routes** (at least two between every consecutive tier pair, recorded in `layout.reactor.routes`):
  - the wall switchback stairs (main);
  - the bridge + tower line (a second flight set);
  - maintenance ladders by the pipe bank.

  Retreat is the same world back up.
- **Seeded variation within the kit:** which wall hosts the switchbacks / pipe organ / generator landings, the gallery arcs, the
  bridge tiers, the tower count and position, and the room order. B's identity (crane, organ wall, generator landings, bridges +
  towers, vessel) is always there.

## Gas: two approaches, no deadlock
- **Depth gas** (`ReactorAir`, a pure function of height): three zones.
  - Zone ids are 0-based: tiers 1–2, tiers 3–4, the core floor.
  - Stratified and thickening downward, with readable bands; the rim breathes.
  - Exposure goes through the existing threshold / dps / mask + filter / HUD / cough path. The Blightbelly's puffs and every other
    level's gas are unchanged.
- **Generator route** (no mask needed):
  - Each zone's auxiliary generator stands in air that is already clean or cleared: tier 1, tier 2 and tier 4.
  - Hold E 2 s to start it. It cranks, then its zone's fans spool and the zone clears in 3 visible stages (top first, about 55 s).
  - The clearing persists, and revisits never re-roll it.
  - A running generator is LOUD: it alerts existing enemies at the landing. Nothing spawns.
- **Filter route:** wear the mask and spend filters. The level always holds one mask and a tight filter supply, and the core floor is
  deadly without one. Mixed play (clear what you fight on, mask through what you cross) is expected.

## The restart (credible industrial work, no puzzle)
1. **Startup key**: in the rim control office. It is picked up on the way down.
2. **Control power**:
   - Seat two fuse cartridges in the switchgear on tier 4. Three are placed, in stores on tier 3, tier 4 and the core floor, never
     inside the switchgear room.
   - Then hold the main breaker (1 s).
3. **Coolant**: in the pump hall, hold the coolant valve open (3 s), then start the circulation pump (needs control power).
4. **Rods**: in the control room, turn the key in the console's key switch, then hold to withdraw the rods (4 s). Needs the key, power
   and coolant.

The parts are finite: placed once, consumed once, never in a loot table. Every step persists, so a retreat keeps it. The status
boards (rim pit board, switchgear, pump, control monitor) and the HUD line show each task's state.

## The win (diegetic, bounded, no cutscene)
- The core comes alive (its glow ramps over about 6 s).
- Then the industrial lighting and fans sequence UP through the pit, tier by tier, from the core floor to the rim, over about 20 s.
  The pit's lamps are flicker circuit 2, held at 0 until now.
- The pit's gas clears (about 40 s).
- The control monitor and the rim board switch to the surface ventilation network: six pre-existing surface ventilation towers
  receive power one by one.
- A persistent local milestone "Reactor restarted / run complete" is written (localStorage `terminal-state.milestones.v1`), and the
  title screen shows its badge.
- The canon: the surface gas that turns people into zombies is being pulled out of the air, slowly. It is NOT a cure: the zombies
  stay and nothing despawns.
- The run continues; nothing is reset.

## The train
The rim station is a shared Trench beside its start platform, so the shared player train (`gen/playerTrain.ts`
`playerTrainPlacement`, PR 33) parks there with no train-side change. It sits inside `layout.reactor.arrival`'s stop window, and a
start arrival spawns in the car. `layout.reactor.start` stays the platform start for callers without a train.

## Enemies
Existing families only. Density and the nastier families rise with depth (`docs/enemy-spawns.md` "The Reactor"):

- rat/dogs flank on the catwalks;
- Blightbellies are on the deep tiers;
- at most two sleeping Sirens are in deep side rooms;
- the Strainer appears only in the rim station's annex.

## Lamps, the open top and gas visibility (expansion lane GASLIGHT)
- **Every pit lamp is a real, mounted fixture** (`gen/reactor/gaslightLamps.ts` `planPitLamps`, `LightPlacement.mount`):
  - wall brackets between the pilasters on every storey, clear of openings, pipe banks, fans and any walkway or flight at the head;
  - posts on the bridges and tower decks.

  `world/reactor/gaslightFixtures.ts` draws the bracket, post and cage (or the flood-lamp model) with the kit. The fixture's tube
  instance is the lens, so the glass glows exactly when the baked light does. The kit plans no decorative lamps.
- **Circuits:** the rim is on station power. Every third lamp and the lamps at the generator / stair landings are steady dim emergency
  lamps. The rest are on the powered circuit 2: dark glass and no light until the restart.
- **The open top:** `levels[0].sky` sits at the pit roof line (no roof slab; the beam grid stays).
  - `world/reactor/gaslightSky.ts` draws the Office's toxic sky dome and the outside gas sheets over the opening.
  - The march's regional term draws the toxic surface air above the roof line (`world/gaslightRules.ts` `reactorOutdoorGas`). The
    exposure reads the same function, and nothing walkable reaches it.
  - The same term draws the sky's light shafts into the pit.
- **Gas visibility** (root `CLAUDE.md` rule): the strata glow toxic green (`REACTOR_GAS_LOOK`) and the clean pit fog is neutral grey.
  A volumetric pass that is off falls back to the scene fog tinted by the eye's gas (`VolumetricAtmosphere.withGasFog`).
- **Core glow in the fog:** a `PointLight` added with `addScatterLight` and `userData.vfOpen = true` lights the haze and the strata with
  no occlusion window (open pit volumes).
- QA: `__LL.gaslight()` and `__LL.gaslightShafts({gain, fade, colour})`. Tests: `game/tests/reactor-x-gaslight-*.test.ts`.
